-- Question 23
-- Table: Students

-- +---------------+---------+
-- | Column Name   | Type    |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | student_id    | int     |
-- | student_name  | varchar |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- student_id is the primary key for this table.
-- Each row of this table contains the ID and the name of one student in the school.
 

-- Table: Subjects

-- +--------------+---------+
-- | Column Name  | Type    |
-- +--------------+---------+
-- | subject_name | varchar |
-- +--------------+---------+
-- subject_name is the primary key for this table.
-- Each row of this table contains the name of one subject in the school.
 

-- Table: Examinations

-- +--------------+---------+
-- | Column Name  | Type    |
-- +--------------+---------+
-- | student_id   | int     |
-- | subject_name | varchar |
-- +--------------+---------+
-- There is no primary key for this table. It may contain duplicates.
-- Each student from the Students table takes every course from Subjects table.
-- Each row of this table indicates that a student with ID student_id attended the exam of subject_name.
 

-- Write an SQL query to find the number of times each student attended each exam.

-- Order the result table by student_id and subject_name.

-- The query result format is in the following example:

-- Students table:
-- +------------+--------------+
-- | student_id | student_name |
-- +------------+--------------+
-- | 1          | Alice        |
-- | 2          | Bob          |
-- | 13         | John         |
-- | 6          | Alex         |
-- +------------+--------------+
-- Subjects table:
-- +--------------+
-- | subject_name |
-- +--------------+
-- | Math         |

-- The result table should contain all students and all subjects.
-- Alice attended Math exam 3 times, Physics exam 2 times and Programming exam 1 time.
-- Bob attended Math exam 1 time, Programming exam 1 time and didn't attend the Physics exam.
-- Alex didn't attend any exam.
-- John attended Math exam 1 time, Physics exam 1 time and Programming exam 1 time.
