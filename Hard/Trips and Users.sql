-- Question 98
-- The Trips table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique Id, while Client_Id and Driver_Id are both foreign keys to the Users_Id at the Users table. Status is an ENUM type of (‘completed’, ‘cancelled_by_driver’, ‘cancelled_by_client’).

-- The Users table holds all users. Each user has an unique Users_Id, and Role is an ENUM type of (‘client’, ‘driver’, ‘partner’).

-- | Users_Id | Banned |  Role  |
-- +----------+--------+--------+
-- |    1     |   No   | client |
-- |    2     |   Yes  | client |
-- |    3     |   No   | client |
-- |    4     |   No   | client |
-- |    10    |   No   | driver |
-- |    11    |   No   | driver |
-- |    12    |   No   | driver |

-- Write a SQL query to find the cancellation rate of requests made by unbanned users (both client and driver must be unbanned) between Oct 1, 2013 and Oct 3, 2013. The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests made by unbanned users by the total number of requests made by unbanned users.

-- For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows with the cancellation rate being rounded to two decimal places.

-- +------------+-------------------+
-- |     Day    | Cancellation Rate |
-- +------------+-------------------+
-- | 2013-10-01 |       0.33        |
-- | 2013-10-02 |       0.00        |
-- | 2013-10-03 |       0.50        |

-- Solution
with t1 as(
select request_at, count(status) as total
from trips 
where client_id = any(select users_id
from users
where banned != 'Yes') 
and driver_id = any(select users_id
from users
where banned != 'Yes')
and request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'
group by request_at),

t2 as
( select request_at, count(status) as cancel
from trips 
where client_id = any(select users_id
from users
where banned != 'Yes') 
and driver_id = any(select users_id
from users
where banned != 'Yes')
and request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'
and status != 'completed'
group by request_at
)

select request_at as Day, coalesce(round((cancel+0.00)/(total+0.00),2),0) as "Cancellation Rate"
from t1 left join t2
using(request_at)
