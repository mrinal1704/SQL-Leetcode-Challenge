-- Question 71
-- Table: Customer

-- +---------------+---------+
-- | Column Name   | Type    |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | customer_id   | int     |
-- | name          | varchar |
-- | visited_on    | date    |
-- | amount        | int     |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- (customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.
-- This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.
-- visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) have visited the restaurant.
-- amount is the total paid by a customer.
 

-- You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).

-- Write an SQL query to compute moving average of how much customer paid in a 7 days window (current day + 6 days before) .

-- The query result format is in the following example:

-- Return result table ordered by visited_on.

-- average_amount should be rounded to 2 decimal places, all dates are in the format ('YYYY-MM-DD').

-- Result table:
-- +--------------+--------------+----------------+
-- | visited_on   | amount       | average_amount |
-- +--------------+--------------+----------------+
-- | 2019-01-07   | 860          | 122.86         |

-- | 2019-01-10   | 1000         | 142.86         |
-- +--------------+--------------+----------------+

-- 1st moving average from 2019-01-01 to 2019-01-07 has an average_amount of (100 + 110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150)/7 = 122.86
-- 2nd moving average from 2019-01-02 to 2019-01-08 has an average_amount of (110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80)/7 = 120
-- 3rd moving average from 2019-01-03 to 2019-01-09 has an average_amount of (120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110)/7 = 120
-- 4th moving average from 2019-01-04 to 2019-01-10 has an average_amount of (130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110 + 130 + 150)/7 = 142.86

-- Solution
select visited_on, sum(amount) over(order by visited_on rows 6 preceding),
round(avg(amount) over(order by visited_on rows 6 preceding),2)
from 
(
	select visited_on, sum(amount) as amount
	from customer
	group by visited_on
	order by visited_on
) a
order by visited_on offset 6 rows
